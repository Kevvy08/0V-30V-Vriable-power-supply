🔧 0–30V Variable Power Supply Project
This project simulates a 0–30V adjustable DC power supply using Proteus 8. It's designed to deliver a variable and stable output voltage for powering a wide range of electronic circuits and prototyping needs.

⚙️ Key Features
Adjustable Output Voltage: 0V to 30V via a potentiometer.

Digital Volt/Ammeter Display: Shows real-time voltage and current.

Simulation-Ready: Designed and tested entirely in Proteus 8.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Proteus 8 (ISIS and ARES for simulation and PCB layout)

 Voltage Regulators, Transistors

Multimeter Modules for voltage/current visualization
